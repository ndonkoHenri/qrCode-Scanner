# QR Code Scanner !
This is a basic Computer Vision Program made to scan through QR Codes in an image or in real-time!
Awesome right? :)

# The Algorithm || How it works?*  
You might ask yourself how precisely does this great tool work...?
An Algorithm is the simplest and understandable way to represent a program.

Have a look o_o:
- It works by collecting given objects such as: images and/or in real-time(ex:Webcam);
- Using the pyzbar python library, it scans through the given objects(image or webcam), searching for what you know ~ QR Codes;
- When detected, it the decodes the QRCode returning the it's content and actual location in frame;
- A bounding box is then drawn around this detected QRCode, and the decoded content of the QRCode showed on top.

# Why use this Program amongst all out there?
In a sincere way, I will tell you some reasons for you to use this program...

- Remember it has two Programs: One made only for Images Scanning and the other for Real-Time Scanning;
- The Speed is just astonishing: 0:00:01.114509 seconds;
- Comments all over, for better understanding of the code;
- The Programs respect the Python Code Styling and Syntax format

Thanks for using my Programs!! :-)
