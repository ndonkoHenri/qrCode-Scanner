# QR Code Scanner !
This is a basic Computer Vision Program made to scan through QR Codes in an image or in real-time!
Awesome right? :)
A Web-App version of this program has been built and could be viewed by clicking on -> [QR WEB-APP](https://qrscanner.anvil.app/)

# The Algorithm || How it works?
You might ask yourself how precisely does this great tool work...?
An Algorithm is the simplest and understandable way to represent a program.

Have a look o_o:
- It works by collecting given objects such as: images, Video or Real-time Captures(ex: Webcam);
- Using the pyzbar python library, it scans through the given objects(image or webcam), searching for what you know ~ QR Codes;
- When detected, it then decodes the QRCode returning the it's content and actual location in frame;
- A bounding box is then drawn around this detected QRCode, and the decoded content of the QRCode showed on top.

# Why use this Program amongst all out there?
In a sincere way, I will tell you some reasons for you to use this program...

- Remember it has two Programs: One made only for Images Scanning and the other for Real-Time Scanning;
- The Speed is just astonishing, less than 0:00:01.114509 seconds;
- Comments all over, for better understanding of the code;
- Try it out to find more interesting features(ex: speed) and let me know...

Thanks for using my Programs!! :-)
